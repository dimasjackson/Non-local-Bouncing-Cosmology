# Non-local-Bouncing-Cosmology
Mathematica notebooks to calculate the non-local distortion function and solve the modified field equations in Deser-Woodard gravity.
These notebooks contains the reconstruction of the Lambda-CDM accelerated expansion of the universe using non-local corrections to 
the Einstein Field Equations according to Deser-Woodard (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08075 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11223)
We also calculated the solutions in different bounce cosmology scenarios. 
The detailed calculations and discussion were presented in a paper by our group recently: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10008
